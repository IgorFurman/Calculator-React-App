## ðŸŒŸ Features

- Basic arithmetic operations including addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division.
- Supports more complex mathematical operations such as percentage and square operation (^).
- Clear all input using the clear button (C).
- Clean and intuitive UI which includes an input display and an interactive grid of buttons.

## ðŸš€ How it Works

The application manages all inputs through local state and react hooks. The state is updated when you press a button on the calculator. The evaluate function from the mathjs library is used to calculate the result when you press the equals button (=).

The styling of the calculator is handled through styled-components to create a clean and responsive layout. It includes the grid of buttons as well as individual styles for number, operation, and clear buttons. These styles also include hover effects for a better user experience.

## ðŸ“‚ Project Structure 

The main application logic resides in `App.js`. It handles all the calculator operations and also renders the main components. The styled-components are in a separate file and imported into `App.js`.

This application consists of several reusable components:

- **NumberButton**: Displays a button with a number and triggers the `handleButtonClick` function when clicked.
- **OperationButton**: Displays a button with an operation symbol and triggers the `handleButtonClick` function when clicked.
- **ClearButton**: Displays a button for clearing all inputs and triggers the `handleClear` function when clicked.
